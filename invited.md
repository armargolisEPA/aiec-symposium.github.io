<h3 style="text-align: justify" id="keynote-abstract---download-slides">Query-Checking for Finite Linear-Time Temporal Logic</h3>

<p>This talk addresses the following problem:  given a finite set of observations of system behavior, each observation 
itself being a finite sequence of system states, and a query consisting of a Finite Linear-Time Temporal Logic (LTL) 
formula with missing sub-formulas, compute missing the missing sub-formulas that make the formula true for all observations.  
This so-called query-checking problem has many applications in the analysis of time-series data, including server logs and 
financial trend data, as well as generally in system comprehension and system-specification mining.  The presentation first 
introduces Finite LTL, which is the well-known LTL logic of Pnueli interpreted over finite, rather than infinite, state sequences.  
It will then show how automata may be constructed from such formulas that recognize exactly the sequences making the formula true, 
and how these automata may be adapted to Finite LTL queries in which sub-formulas are missing.  A procedure is then described that 
uses the automaton representation of such a query to solve for the missing sub-formulas for a given a set of finite state sequences.  
Preliminary experimental results of a prototype implementation are also given.
This work is joint with Sam Huang.

<p style="text-align: justify">Giuseppe De Giacomo is currently a Professor of Computer Science at the Department of 
Computer Science of the University of Oxford. For several years he has been a professor at the Department of Computer, 
Control and Management Engineering of the University of Roma "La Sapienza". His research activity has concerned theoretical, 
methodological, and practical aspects in different areas of AI and CS, most prominently Knowledge Representation, 
Reasoning about Actions, Generalized Planning, Autonomous Agents, Service Composition, Business Process Modeling, 
and Data Management and Integration. He is AAAI Fellow, ACM Fellow, and EurAI Fellow. He has got an ERC Advanced Grant 
for the project WhiteMech: White-box Self Programming Mechanisms (2019-2024). He has been the Program Chair of ECAI 2020. 
He is on the Board of EurAI.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify" id="keynote-abstract---download-slides">Linear-time Temporal Logics on Finite Traces</h3>
<p>In this talk we look at temporal logics on traces that are assumed to be finite, as typical of action planning in
Artificial Intelligence and of processes modeling in Business Process Management.  Having to deal with finite traces has 
been considered a sort of accident in much of the AI and BPM literature, and standard temporal logics on infinite traces 
have been hacked to fit this assumption. Only recently a specific interest in studying the impact of such an assumption 
has emerged.  We will survey linear temporal logics on finite traces, including LTLf, LDLf, and pure-past LTL, reviewing 
the main results on Reasoning, Verification, and Synthesis. The talk will also draw connections with work in AI planning, 
Non-Markovin Decision Processes, Reinforcement Learning, and BPM Declarative Process Modeling, that will then be elaborated 
on in separate talks by workshop participants.</p>

<h2 id="sheila">Invited Speaker: <em>Sheila McIlraith </em></h2>
<p><img src="/assets/img/sheila.jpg" alt="degiacomo" class="img-responsive" style="max-width: 40%; float: left; border-radius: 3%; margin-right: 25px" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Sheila McIlraith is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University 
of Toronto, a Canada CIFAR AI Chair (Vector Institute), and an Associate Director at the Schwartz Reisman Institute for 
Technology and Society. Prior to joining U of T, McIlraith spent six years as a Research Scientist at Stanford University, 
and one year at Xerox PARC. McIlraith’s research is in the area of AI knowledge representation and reasoning, and machine 
learning where she currently studies sequential decision-making, broadly construed, with a focus on human-compatible AI. 
McIlraith is a Fellow of the ACM and the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). She and co-authors 
have been recognized with two test-of-time awards from the International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC) in 2011, and from the 
International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) in 2022.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify" id="keynote-abstract---download-slides">Automated Planning with LTL: Techniques, Advances, and its Broad Applicability
</h3>
<p>Given a description of the dynamics of an environment, the initial state of the world, and a goal condition, 
automated symbolic planning generates a plan – typically a sequence of actions – that, when executed starting in the 
initial state, achieves the goal condition. Over the last 20+ years, research in automated planning has resulted in 
highly efficient algorithms for plan generation under varying models of the environment and goal conditions. 
In this talk, I’ll briefly review this literature, focusing on techniques for planning with temporally extended goals 
expressed in syntactic variants of LTL and regular expressions, interpreted over finite or infinite traces.  
I’ll show how planning in deterministic or nondeterministic systems with such temporally extended goals (or preferences) 
can be used as the computational core for a diverse set of tasks from web service composition to narrative understanding, 
goal recognition, automated diagnosis, and reactive synthesis. I’ll conclude with a brief discussion of how some of these 
same insights have been repurposed in the context of reinforcement learning, solving problems that otherwise could not be solved.</p>
