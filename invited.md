<p style="text-align: justify">Giuseppe De Giacomo is currently a Professor of Computer Science at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Oxford. For several years he has been a professor at the Department of Computer, Control and Management Engineering of the University of Roma "La Sapienza". His research activity has concerned theoretical, methodological, and practical aspects in different areas of AI and CS, most prominently Knowledge Representation, Reasoning about Actions, Generalized Planning, Autonomous Agents, Service Composition, Business Process Modeling, and Data Management and Integration. He is AAAI Fellow, ACM Fellow, and EurAI Fellow. He has got an ERC Advanced Grant for the project WhiteMech: White-box Self Programming Mechanisms (2019-2024). He has been the Program Chair of ECAI 2020. He is on the Board of EurAI.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify" id="keynote-abstract---download-slides">Linear-time Temporal Logics on Finite Traces</h3>
<p>In this talk we look at temporal logics on traces that are assumed to be finite, as typical of action planning in Artificial Intelligence and of processes modeling in Business Process Management.  Having to deal with finite traces has been considered a sort of accident in much of the AI and BPM literature, and standard temporal logics on infinite traces have been hacked to fit this assumption. Only recently a specific interest in studying the impact of such an assumption has emerged.  We will survey linear temporal logics on finite traces, including LTLf, LDLf, and pure-past LTL, reviewing the main results on Reasoning, Verification, and Synthesis. The talk will also draw connections with work in AI planning, Non-Markovin Decision Processes, Reinforcement Learning, and BPM Declarative Process Modeling, that will then be elaborated on in separate talks by workshop participants.</p>
