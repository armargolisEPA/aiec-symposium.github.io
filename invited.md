<p style="text-align: justify">Rance Cleaveland is Professor of Computer Science at the University of Maryland in College Park, w
here he also serves as Associate Dean of Research for the College of Computing, Mathematical and Natural Sciences.  
He has published widely in the areas of software verification and validation, formal methods, model checking, software 
specification formalisms, and verification tools.  Cleaveland received B.S. degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science 
from Duke University, and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Cornell University.  He is a Fellow of the IEEE and recently finished 
a four-year stint as Division Director of Computing and Communication Foundations at the US National Science Foundation.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify" id="keynote-abstract---download-slides">Query-Checking for Finite Linear-Time Temporal Logic</h3>

<p>This talk addresses the following problem:  given a finite set of observations of system behavior, each observation 
itself being a finite sequence of system states, and a query consisting of a Finite Linear-Time Temporal Logic (LTL) 
formula with missing sub-formulas, compute missing the missing sub-formulas that make the formula true for all observations.  
This so-called query-checking problem has many applications in the analysis of time-series data, including server logs and 
financial trend data, as well as generally in system comprehension and system-specification mining.  The presentation first 
introduces Finite LTL, which is the well-known LTL logic of Pnueli interpreted over finite, rather than infinite, state sequences.  
It will then show how automata may be constructed from such formulas that recognize exactly the sequences making the formula true, 
and how these automata may be adapted to Finite LTL queries in which sub-formulas are missing.  A procedure is then described that 
uses the automaton representation of such a query to solve for the missing sub-formulas for a given a set of finite state sequences.  
Preliminary experimental results of a prototype implementation are also given.
This work is joint with Sam Huang.

<p style="text-align: justify">Giuseppe De Giacomo is currently a Professor of Computer Science at the Department of 
Computer Science of the University of Oxford. For several years he has been a professor at the Department of Computer, 
Control and Management Engineering of the University of Roma "La Sapienza". His research activity has concerned theoretical, 
methodological, and practical aspects in different areas of AI and CS, most prominently Knowledge Representation, 
Reasoning about Actions, Generalized Planning, Autonomous Agents, Service Composition, Business Process Modeling, 
and Data Management and Integration. He is AAAI Fellow, ACM Fellow, and EurAI Fellow. He has got an ERC Advanced Grant 
for the project WhiteMech: White-box Self Programming Mechanisms (2019-2024). He has been the Program Chair of ECAI 2020. 
He is on the Board of EurAI.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify" id="keynote-abstract---download-slides">Linear-time Temporal Logics on Finite Traces</h3>
<p>In this talk we look at temporal logics on traces that are assumed to be finite, as typical of action planning in
Artificial Intelligence and of processes modeling in Business Process Management.  Having to deal with finite traces has 
been considered a sort of accident in much of the AI and BPM literature, and standard temporal logics on infinite traces 
have been hacked to fit this assumption. Only recently a specific interest in studying the impact of such an assumption 
has emerged.  We will survey linear temporal logics on finite traces, including LTLf, LDLf, and pure-past LTL, reviewing 
the main results on Reasoning, Verification, and Synthesis. The talk will also draw connections with work in AI planning, 
Non-Markovin Decision Processes, Reinforcement Learning, and BPM Declarative Process Modeling, that will then be elaborated 
on in separate talks by workshop participants.</p>
