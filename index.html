title: Using Artificial Intelligence and Big Data for Improving Enforcement and Design of Environmental Regulations 
subtitle:  AAAI 2024  Spring Symposium Series, March 25-27, 2024, Stanford, CA, USA
---

<!--
The symposium would focus on how big data and machine learning models can be leveraged for:  

Enhancing enforcement capabilities and regulatory effectiveness: Combining administrative datasets
on facility characteristics and violation history with machine learning models to predict future 
violations, target inspections, and reduce enforcement costs.

Improving detection of emissions from vehicles and facilities: Using remote sensing technology,
machine learning algorithms, database design, and state of the art policy evaluation methods to
study, measure, and reduce emissions. 

Improving design of environmental regulations: Combining granular (spatial and temporal) pollution
and congestion data with machine learning based causal identification techniques to inform the
distributional pollution impact of congestion pricing.
