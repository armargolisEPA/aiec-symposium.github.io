title: On the Effectiveness of Temporal Logics on Finite Traces in AI
subtitle:  AAAI 2023  Spring Symposium Series, March 27-29, 2023, Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport, CA, USA
---

<!--
Temporal logics, such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), are widely adopted as a logical specification language for verification in Formal Methods 
(one of the most successful uses of logic in Computer Science). They are also getting increasing attention by the AI Community. However, 
AI has been looking at finite trace variants of such logics, typically interpreted over infinite traces. The reason to focus on finite traces comes 
from the consideration that given a task, an intelligent agent should (1) think, (2) deliberate a course of actions, (3) execute such actions, 
and (4) be ready for the next task. If the task requires an infinite execution, then the agent would reason only once in its lifetime and then 
execute what deliberated for the rest of its life. A key feature of working with finite traces is the possibility to rely on finite-state automata, 
rather than more complex omega-automata required for infinite traces. This is a great simplification that has had impacts on very many areas of AI and CS, 
including Planning, Program Synthesis, Reinforcement Learning, Automated Reasoning, Knowledge Representation, Multi-Agent Systems, Robotics, 
Discrete Event Control, Workflow Management, Conversational Systems, Automated Service Composition, Business Process Management, Fintech, Cyber Security, 
and many more.

Temporal logics, such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), are widely adopted as a logical specification language in Formal
Methods. They are also getting increasing attention from the AI Community. In AI, however, there is often a need to
interpret such logics over finite traces, rather than the traditional infinite-trace interpretation. This is evident,
for instance, in Planning and Business Process Management. An important computational feature of working with finite
traces is that it allows one to use standard finite-state automata to model and reason, rather than the more complex
omega-automata used for infinite traces. This is a great simplification that has already had a significant impact on 
many areas of AI and CS.

  <br>
This symposium, part of the <a href="https://aaai.org/Symposia/Spring/sss23.php">AAAI'23  Spring Symposium Series</a>,
aims to bring together researchers working with temporal logics on finite traces, in basic research and applications,
in order to foster a common space to discuss current results and future directions and to facilitate the emergence of
teams working across different areas.
<br>

<!--
Moreover, the symposium wants to promote demos of performing tools for linear temporal logics on finite traces, also in light of the opening of a new 
track specifically dedicated to finite traces in the world-wide competition of program synthesis (<a href="http://www.syntcomp.org/">SYNTCOMP</a>).
