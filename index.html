title: LTL <sub>f</sub> Workshop
subtitle: to fill
---


The workshop (symposium) aims to bring together researchers working on Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces
(LTLf) in the areas of Formal Methods, Planning, Reinforcement Learning, Robotics, Business Process Management, etc.
The idea is to bring together people interested in LTLf and create a common space to discuss current results,
future directions, and possible applications.

Linear Temporal Logics over finite traces (LTLf), and its extension with regular expression, Linear Dynamic Logic
(LDLf ), are important logic formalisms extensively used in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science.
The key feature for this interest is due the the possibility of transforming LTLf/LDLf formulas into
Finite-state Automaton (DFA), rather then more complex omega-automata, as for LTL,  which can then be
suitably employed in different contexts. Indeed, we can find an extensive use of LTLf in Reactive Synthesis,
in FOND with temporal specifications, to express trajectory constraints in PDDL, in the theory of Markov Decision
Processes to capture non-Markovian rewards with applications in Reinforcement Learning, and for expressing process
properties in Business Process Mining.
