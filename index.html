title: On the Effectiveness of Temporal Logics on Finite Traces in AI
#subtitle: to fill
---

Temporal logics, such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), are widely adopted as a logical specification language for verification in Formal Methods 
(one of the most successful uses of logic in Computer Science). They are also getting increasing attention by the AI Community. However, 
AI has been looking at finite trace variants of such logics, typically interpreted over infinite traces. The reason to focus on finite traces comes 
from the consideration that given a task, an intelligent agent should (1) think, (2) deliberate a course of actions, (3) execute such actions, 
and (4) be ready for the next task. If the task requires an infinite execution, then the agent would reason only once in its lifetime and then 
execute what deliberated for the rest of its life. A key feature of working with finite traces is the possibility to rely on finite-state automata, 
rather than more complex omega-automata required for infinite traces. This is a great simplification that has had impacts on very many areas of AI and CS, 
including Planning, Program Synthesis, Reinforcement Learning, Automated Reasoning, Knowledge Representation, Multi-Agent Systems, Robotics, 
Discrete Event Control, Workflow Management, Conversational Systems, Automated Service Composition, Business Process Management, Fintech, Cyber Security, 
and many more.

<br>
This symposium aims to bring together researchers working in all these areas of AI and CS to develop and foster a common space to discuss current results, 
future directions in basic research and applications, and facilitating the emergence of synergies across different areas.
<br>
<br>
Moreover, the symposium wants to promote demos of performing tools for linear temporal logics on finite traces, also in light of the opening of a new 
track specifically dedicated to finite traces in the world-wide competition of program synthesis (<a href="http://www.syntcomp.org/">SYNTCOMP</a>).
